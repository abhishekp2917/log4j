            This is the root element for configuring a child logger. It is used to define and configure a specific logger
            within the logging framework. The content within this element specifies the logger's behavior.

                -   name: The name attribute specifies the name of the logger. In this case, the logger is named
                    "org.example.Account." Loggers are typically named based on the class or component they are
                    associated with. This name is used to identify the logger in your code.

                -   level: The level attribute indicates the logging level for this logger. Here the logging level is
                    set to "trace." This means that the logger will capture log events at the "trace" level and all levels
                    above it (i.e., "trace," "debug," "info," "warn," "error," "fatal").

                -   additivity: The additivity attribute determines whether log events generated by this logger should
                    be passed up to higher-level loggers in the logger hierarchy. If set to "false," log events will not
                    be propagated to ancestor loggers.

                    if set to true, the log message of this logger will also be logged by its parent logger (in this
                    case it is root logger).

            If we don't specify the level, additivity or Appender of the child logger, then it will inherit these
            details from parent logger (in this case it's root logger)
